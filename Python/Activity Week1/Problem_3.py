'''
Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions 
# The number must be divisible by five 
# If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number 
# If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop 
● Test Case 1: 
    Input : 12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50 
    Output : [75, 150, 145]  
● Test Case 2: 
    Input : 14, 85, 625, 75 
    Output : [85]
